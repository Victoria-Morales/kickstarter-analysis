 **Recommendation**
 Kickstarter campaigns for plays have proven to be pretty successful, one of the most successful of all the campaign subcategories on Kickstarter. The best time to iniate the campagin is the month of May. Research into the Edinburgh festival in particular would suggest that you would be successful in trying to get a $35-$50 donation per donor, though their goal was less than yours.
 
 **Other Info**
 In regards to your interest in possibly starting a Musical project in Great Britain with a goal of $4000, I have found that this goal is a stretch. It would be more advisable to lower your goal at least by half.
